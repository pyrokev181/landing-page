***README*** COPYRIGHT 2022 pyrokev181 for The Odin Project

This is my landing page for The Odin Project's Foundations CSS project. The purpose of this project
is to show my knowledge and skills in basic HTML and CSS, including the use of images,
fonts, background, flex-boxes, creating containers, and layout design techniques.

I made this a landing page for a fake blacksmith/ironworks business. I find blacksmithing to be
incredibly interesting and a hobby I would like to do. Photos are credited below.

Feedback is welcome and can be sent to quicksilver1528@yahoo.com
